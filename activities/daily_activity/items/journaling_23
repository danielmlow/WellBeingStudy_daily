    "question": "<b>Awe Narrative</b><br>Think back to a time when you felt a sense of awe regarding something you witnessed or experienced. This sense of awe or vastness can be physical (e.g., a movie or a panoramic view from a mountaintop) or psychological (e.g., a brilliant idea or uplifting experience) or social (a great conversation or act of kindness). People may experience awe when they are in the presence of a beautiful natural landscape or work of art, when they watch a moving speech or performance, when they witness an act of great altruism, or when they have a spiritual or religious experience.  <br><br>Try to think of the most recent experience youâ€™ve had that involved the feeling of awe. Once you identify something, describe it in writing with as much detail as possible for up to 10 minutes.",
