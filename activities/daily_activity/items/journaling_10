    "question": "<b>Best Possible Career</b><br>Take a moment to imagine your life in the future, and focus specifically on your career for the next 3 years. What is the best possible educational, professional or work situation you can imagine? This could involve, for example, being able to study the things you love, be productive, take time off, get any job or promotion you apply for. For the next 10 minutes, write continuously about what you imagined about this best possible future. <br><br>This exercise is most useful when it is very specificâ€”if you think about an academic setting, what exactly would you study, what would that allow you to do, how would you feel? If you think about a new job, describe the institution or company, what your day-to-day would be, what kind of project you would work on, and so on. Describe what steps you could take to achieve this. <br><br>Be as creative and imaginative as you want. Imagine anything was possible and you would achieve anything you set your mind to.",
