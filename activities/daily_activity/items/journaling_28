    "question": "**Cognitive distortion: Overgeneralizing**<br>Learn to how to identify and re-think inaccurate thoughts<br>1. Read a description of the following cognitive distortion. <br>2. Think of a time when you perceived this distortion in yourself. If you can't think of an example, think of when you perceived someone you know. <br>3. Write where you were, what was said or thought, and what emotions you felt.<br>4. Finally, write how you could view this situation in a more accurate manner. What evidence exists against this thought? A good question to ask is: “Would other people accept my thoughts as true?\" <br><br>Description: Someone who overgeneralizes makes hasty generalizations from insufficient evidence. Such as seeing a “single negative event” as a “never-ending pattern of defeat,\" and as such drawing a very broad conclusion from a single incident or a single piece of evidence. Even if something bad happens only once, it is expected to happen over and over again<br><br>Example 1: A young woman is asked out on a first date, but not a second one. She is distraught as she tells her friend, “This always happens to me! I’ll never find love!”<br>Example 2: A man is lonely and often spends most of his time at home. His friends sometimes ask him to dinner and to meet new people. He feels it is useless to even try. No one really could like him. And anyway, all people are the same; petty and selfish.<br>One suggestion to combat this distortion is to “examine the evidence” by performing an accurate analysis of one's situation. This aids in avoiding exaggerating one's circumstances. <br>",
