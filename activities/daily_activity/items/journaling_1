    "question": "Take a moment to imagine your life in the future, and focus specifically on your relationships during the next 3 years. What is the best possible romantic, social, and family life you can imagine? This could involve, for example, having a supportive partner, good relationships with your children or parents, and a close group of friends.<br><br> For the next 10 minutes, write continuously about what you imagined about these best possible future relationships.<br><br> This exercise is most useful when it is very specificâ€”if you think about having a better relationship with your parents, for instance, describe exactly what would be different in the ways you relate to each other; if you think about having a partner or new friend, describe how they interact with you, what you might do together, and so on. Describe what steps you could take to achieve this.<br><br> Be as creative and imaginative as you want. Imagine anything was possible and you would achieve anything you set your mind to.<br>",
