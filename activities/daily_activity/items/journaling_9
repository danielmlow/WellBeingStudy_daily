    "question": "Write down up to five things for which you feel grateful. The physical record is important—don’t just do this exercise in your head. The things you list can be relatively small in importance (“The tasty sandwich I had for lunch today.”) or relatively large (“My sister gave birth to a healthy baby boy.”). <br><br>The goal of the exercise is to remember a good event, experience, person, or thing in your life—then enjoy the good emotions that come with it. Be as specific as possible—specificity is key to fostering gratitude. “I’m grateful that my roommate made me dinner when I was sick on Tuesday” will be more effective than “I’m grateful for my roommate.”",
