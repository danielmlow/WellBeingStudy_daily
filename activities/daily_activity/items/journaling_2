This could be a relative, friend, teacher, or colleague. Try to pick someone who is still alive. It may be most helpful to select a person or act that you haven’t thought about for a while—something that isn’t always on your mind.<br><br>Now, write a letter to one of these people, guided by the following steps:<br>1. Write as though you are addressing this person directly <br>2. Describe in specific terms what this person did, why you are grateful to this person, and how this person’s behavior affected your life. Try to be as concrete as possible.<br>3. Recall different things you have done together and how their support has helped you.<br>4. Describe what you are doing in your life now and how you often remember their efforts.",
