    "question": "**Cognitive distortion: Emotional reasoning**<br>Learn to how to identify and re-think inaccurate thoughts<br>1. Read a description of the following cognitive distortion. <br>2. Think of a time when you perceived this distortion in yourself. If you can't think of an example, think of when you perceived someone you know. <br>3. Write where you were, what was said or thought, and what emotions you felt.<br>4. Finally, write how you could view this situation in a more accurate manner. What evidence exists against this thought? A good question to ask is: “Would other people accept my thoughts as true?\" <br><br>Description: Emotional reasoning refers to the acceptance of one’s emotions as fact. It can be described as “I feel it, therefore it must be true.” Just because we feel something doesn’t mean it is true; for example, we may become jealous and think our partner has feelings for someone else, but that doesn’t make it true. Of course, we know it isn’t reasonable to take our feelings as fact, but it is a common distortion nonetheless.<br><br>Examples: \"I feel stupid, therefore I must be stupid\". Feeling fear of flying in planes, and then concluding that planes must be a dangerous way to travel. Feeling overwhelmed by the prospect of cleaning one's house, therefore concluding that it's hopeless to even start cleaning. <br>",
