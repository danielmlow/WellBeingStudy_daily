    "question": "Take a step back and analyze your feelings without ruminating:<br>Bring to mind a difficult experience you are dealing with: some event in the past that made you sad or angry or some anxiety or worry you have about the future. <br>Try to understand your feelings using “he/she/they,” as much as possible. For example, you would ask yourself, “Why does she feel this way? What are the underlying causes and reasons for her feelings?” If you begin to see the event in your mind, try to watch through the eyes of a distanced, third-party observer, rather than through your own eyes.<br>The goal here is not to avoid or separate from your feelings, but to analyze them from a clearer and more helpful vantage point. Spend up to 10 minutes reflecting in this way, writing down the issue and describing how this other person is feeling and why they are feeling this way.<br>",
