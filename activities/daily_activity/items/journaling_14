    "question": "Identify one goal that you would like to achieve in the next day or two and briefly describe it in writing. Make sure that this goal is realistic and not too time-consuming (e.g., “tidy up the hall closet” rather than “clean the entire house top to bottom”) and something that is important to you (e.g., “spend more time with the kids” rather than “learn about the life cycle of the common fly”).<br><br>Describe in writing the steps that you will take to get there. For example, if your goal is to tidy up the hall closet, these are the steps that you might take to achieve it: a) schedule one hour tonight that you will devote to cleaning; b) turn off your cell phone/other distractors; c) turn on some upbeat music; d) break down the job into sub-tasks: take everything out of the closet, sweep the floor, dust the shelves, get rid of stuff that you don’t need anymore, sort the things that you want to keep and put them in boxes, put the boxes back in the closet; f) remind yourself that it’s OK if you don’t do everything perfectly, or complete the entire task.",
