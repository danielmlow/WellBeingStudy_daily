    "question": "<b>Three Funny Things</b><br>Write down the three funniest things you heard, saw, did, or experienced recently. Think about the things you found really funny and describe how they made you feel.<br>Also write down the reason why these things were funny. In other words, answer the question: “Why did this funny event happen?” It may be a bit tricky to think about the “why” of the funny things in your life, but it will become easier over the course of the week.<br>It is important to create a physical record of your items by writing them down; it is not enough simply to do this exercise in your head. <br><br>Here are some other tips you may find helpful for your writing: <br>1. Give the event a title (e.g., “joked with my friend about parenting”).<br>2. List any funny things you like: They can be relatively small in importance (e.g., “my partner made a silly face”) or relatively large (e.g., “I went to a comedy show”). <br>3. Remember to write down exactly what happened in as much detail as possible, including what you did or said and, if others were involved, what they did or said.<br>",
