    "question": "Participants were asked to think about what their lives would have been like if a positive event, such as meeting a romantic partner, had never happened; other participants either simply thought about the event or thought about how it was not surprising that the event had happened. The participants who practiced “mental subtraction”—they considered their lives without the positive event—reported feeling more positive states and more gratitude than the other participants did. [Koo et al. (2008). It's a wonderful life: Mentally subtracting positive events improves people's affective states, contrary to their affective forecasts.
