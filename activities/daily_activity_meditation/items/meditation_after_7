    "question": "Great! This was your first anapana meditation with longer silences. How did that feel? Any new insights? Perhaps thoughts came up during the silences? Did you experience any anxiety or discomfort?\r<br>For today try to see if you can formally practice twice a day. This would be great. Before dinner or bed or even right, see if you can sit for a period of time and focus on your breath. Next session, we will learn how to better rest the mind. ",
