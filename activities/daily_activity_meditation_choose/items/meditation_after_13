    "question": "Great! How did that feel? Could you settle your body, speech, and mind in its natural state? And once settled could you just observe the movements of the breath without the urge to control it? Was it challenging to just let it be as it is? And then when you turned to your thoughts, could you also just observe them, without trying to control or modify them? These are challenging tasks, and while it is natural to have thoughts, we can change how we react to them.<br><br>For today, if you get a chance try to do a quick body scan from top to bottom, relaxing and breathing naturally without controlling. When you feel ready, turn your attention to your thoughts, and just observe them.",
