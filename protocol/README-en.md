Today you will do Assessment 2. You will repeat the assessments you did about a month ago to measure how much your baseline can change naturally. Tomorrow you will start the MIT Month of Wellbeing Challenge and will do a single quick wellbeing activity each day. After the month is over we will measure how you've changed!

Today's assessment should take **less than 20 minutes to complete**. You'll need to do it in one sitting. If you close your browser, you'll have to restart the ongoing survey.

If you are using a **laptop or desktop** and run into any **issues**, you can download your data with the Download button in the menu and send it to us. Instructions are at the end of the session under the Submit Responses button in the menu.
